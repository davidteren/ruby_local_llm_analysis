They're used for:\n\n* Code reuse: Modules allow you to create a separate, self-contained class that can be used by other parts of your program.\n* Encapsulation: Modules encapsulate related methods and variables in a single unit, making your code more organized and easier to manage.\n* Namespaces: Modules allow you to define a set of related classes that share the same namespace, making it easier to avoid naming conflicts.\n* Interfaces: Modules can be used as interfaces, allowing other classes to provide methods that are defined in the module but not implemented by default.\n\nHere's a basic example of how modules work:\n```ruby\n# Module\nmodule HelloWorld\n  def self.greet\n    puts \"Hello, world!\"\n  end\nend\n\n# Class that uses the HelloWorld module\nclass MyClass\n  include HelloWorld\n\n  def greet\n    puts \"Greeting from my class!\"\n  end\nend\n```\nWhen you want to use a module, you must include it in your class:\n```ruby\n# Class that uses the HelloWorld module\nclass MyClass\n  include HelloWorld\nend\n```\nYou should use modules when you need to:\n\n* Organize your code and make it easier to understand and maintain.\n* Encapsulate related methods and variables in a single unit.\n* Define interfaces for classes that don't implement them by default.\n* Avoid naming conflicts between classes and modules.\n\nRemember, when including a module in your code, you're not using the class itself (as a method), but rather its namespace. You can still use any methods, variables, and constants from the module in your code without including it.",

      "response": "Ruby has a structured approach to naming conventions, which includes following these guidelines for method and variable names:\n\n1. **Use lowercase letters**: Ruby code should be written in all lowercase letters, except for tildes (~).\n2. **Use camelCase**: When naming classes and methods, use the first letter of each word as a separate word (e.g., `MyClass`).\n3. **Use underscores**: When naming variables, use underscores as separators (e.g., `my_variable`).\n4. **Avoid special characters**: Tools like RSpec can help you avoid using special characters, such as `!`, `_`, or `$`.\n5. **Use consistent casing**: Follow a consistent naming convention throughout your codebase.\n\nSome best practices for method and variable names:\n\n1. **Use verbs**: Choose a verb that describes the action being performed by the method or variable, such as `find`, `read`, or `update`.\n2. **Be descriptive**: Use as many words as possible to describe the purpose of the method or variable, such as `find_by_id` or `load_from_database`.\n3. **Avoid acronyms**: Use full names instead of abbreviations, such as `WebClient` or `Person`.\n4. **Avoid magic numbers**: Use named constants instead of hardcoding values, such as `:path` or `_id`.\n5. **Be consistent**: Follow a consistent naming convention throughout your codebase, such as using `:name` for names.\n6. **Use plural nouns**: Use plural nouns in method and variable names to indicate that the value can be multiple.\n7. **Avoid magic numbers in methods**: If a method is used to retrieve or manipulate data, use a named constant instead of an integer.\n8. **Use abbreviations for short methods**: If the method is short and easy to read, use an abbreviation instead of a full name.\n9. **Avoid unnecessary complexity**: Avoid using complex or arcane names that may confuse others.\n\nExample of a correctly formatted method name: `find_by_id(my_id)`\n\nExample of a correctly formatted variable name: `my_database`",
