This makes it possible to use methods that are shared among multiple classes without having to create an instance of each class.\n\nModules can also define constants that can be used by any class or module that includes them. Constants in a module are accessible using the `::` operator, followed by the name of the module and the constant.\n\nYou should use a Ruby module when you want to organize code into logical groups, share methods among multiple classes, or encapsulate functionality that is not directly related to a specific class. Modules can also be used to provide default implementations for methods that can then be overridden in subclasses.",

      "test_name": "Error Handling",
      "prompt": "Show how to implement error handling in Ruby using begin/rescue blocks.",
      "response": "In Ruby, you can use the `begin/rescue` block structure to handle errors gracefully. This allows your program to continue running even if an error occurs.\n\nHere's a basic example:\n\n```ruby\nbegin\n  # code that might cause an error here\n  result = 10 / 0   # this will raise a ZeroDivisionError\nrescue Exception => e\n  puts \"An error occurred: #{e.message}\"\nend\n\nputs 'Program continues running...'\n```\n\nIn the example above, `result = 10 / 0` would cause an exception (specifically, a `ZeroDivisionError`). The `begin/rescue` block catches this exception and executes the code inside the `rescue` block. In this case, it prints out an error message.\n\nIf you want to catch specific types of exceptions, you can do so by specifying the type after `rescue`. For example:\n\n```ruby\nbegin\n  # code that might cause an error here\n  result = 10 / 'a'   # this will raise a TypeError\nrescue ZeroDivisionError => e\n  puts \"Zero division error occurred: #{e.message}\"\nrescue TypeError => e\n  puts \"Type error occurred: #{e.message}\"\nend\n\nputs 'Program continues running...'\n```\n\nIn the example above, we're catching two specific types of exceptions: `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError`. If a different type of exception is raised, it will not be caught by either rescue block.\n\nYou can also use multiple `rescue` blocks to handle different types of exceptions in different ways. For example:\n\n```ruby\nbegin\n  # code that might cause an error here\n  result = 10 / 'a'   # this will raise a TypeError\nrescue ZeroDivisionError => e\n  puts \"Zero division error occurred: #{e.message}\"\nrescue TypeError => e\n  puts \"Type error occurred: #{e.message}\"\nelse\n  puts \"No exceptions were raised.\"\nend\n\nputs 'Program continues running...'\n```\n\nIn the example above, if no exception is raised in the `begin` block, then the code inside the `else` block will be executed. If an exception is raised, the corresponding `rescue` block will be executed.\n\nFinally, you can use a `ensure` block to execute code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not:\n\n```ruby\nbegin\n  # code that might cause an error here\n  result = 10 / 'a'   # this will raise a TypeError\nrescue ZeroDivisionError => e\n  puts \"Zero division error occurred: #{e.message}\"\nrescue TypeError => e\n  puts \"Type error occurred: #{e.message}\"\nelse\n  puts \"No exceptions were raised.\"\nensure\n  puts \"This code always runs, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\"\nend\n\nputs 'Program continues running...'\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `ensure` block will be executed after all other blocks, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.",

      "test_name": "Ruby Best Practices",
      "prompt": "Explain Ruby naming conventions and best practices for method and variable naming.",
      "response": "Ruby follows several naming conventions and best practices to make the code more readable and maintainable. These conventions help in understanding the purpose of variables, methods, classes, and modules without reading their implementations.\n\n### 1. Method Naming\n\n- **CamelCase**: Methods should be named using `camelCase`. The first word starts with a lowercase letter, and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter.\n  \n  ```ruby\n  def calculateTotal\n    # method implementation\n  end\n  ```\n\n- **Snake_Case**: This convention is used for method names that involve multiple words. Each word is separated by an underscore.\n\n  ```ruby\n  def calculate_total\n    # method implementation\n  end\n  ```\n\n- **Verb-Noun Pattern**: Methods should start with a verb or a noun to indicate what the method does or what it represents.\n\n  ```ruby\n  def findUserById(user_id)\n    # method implementation\n  end\n\n  def createUser(username, password)\n    # method implementation\n  end\n  ```\n\n### 2. Variable Naming\n\n- **Snake_Case**: Similar to method naming, variables should also follow the `snake_case` convention.\n\n  ```ruby\n  user_name = \"John Doe\"\n  total_amount = 100\n  ```\n\n- **Prefix Indicators**: Variables can be prefixed with a type indicator to make it clear what kind of data they hold. For example, `$total`, `@user`, and `@@count`.\n\n  - `$` for global variables.\n  - `@` for instance variables (belonging to an object).\n  - `@@` for class variables (shared among all instances of a class).\n\n  ```ruby\n  $global_var = \"Global\"\n  @instance_var = \"Instance\"\n  @@class_var = \"Class\"\n  ```\n\n### 3. Class and Module Naming\n\n- **CamelCase**: Classes and modules should be named using `CamelCase`. Each word starts with an uppercase letter.\n\n  ```ruby\n  class User\n    # class implementation\n  end\n\n  module MathOperations\n    # module implementation\n  end\n  ```\n\n### 4. Constant Naming\n\n- **UpperCaseLetters**: Constants are typically written in all uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores.\n\n  ```ruby\n  MAX_SIZE = 100\n  PI = 3.14159\n  ```\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Descriptive Names**: Always try to name variables, methods, and classes descriptively so that anyone reading the code can understand its purpose quickly.\n  \n- **Avoid Single Character Names**: Avoid using single characters for variable names unless they are loop counters or temporary values.\n\n  ```ruby\n  # Bad practice\n  i = 0\n\n  # Good practice\n  index = 0\n  ```\n\n- **Consistency**: Adhere to the naming conventions consistently throughout your codebase. This helps in maintaining a uniform style across different parts of the application.\n\n- **Readability**: Focus on writing code that is easy to read and understand. Long descriptive names can sometimes be better than short cryptic ones, especially when describing complex operations or data structures.\n\nBy following these naming conventions and best practices, you can write more readable, maintainable, and scalable Ruby code.",

      "test_name": "Advanced Ruby Features",
      "prompt": "Demonstrate the use of Ruby blocks, procs, and lambdas with examples.",
      "response": "Ruby blocks, procs, and lambdas are all ways to encapsulate code that can be executed later. Each has its own syntax and use cases.\n\n### Blocks\n\nBlocks in Ruby are defined by `do ... end` or `{}`. They are often used with methods like `each`, `map`, `select`, etc., where they perform an operation on each item in the collection.\n\n```ruby\n# Define a block that prints \"Hello, world!\" and then calls it\ndef say_hello_world\n  yield if block_given?\nend\n\nsay_hello_world { puts \"Hello, world!\" }\n```\n\n### Procs\n\nProcs are similar to blocks but can be stored in variables, passed around as arguments, and returned from methods. They are created using `Proc.new` or the shorthand `proc {}`.\n\n```ruby\n# Create a proc that adds 2 to its argument and returns it\nadd_two = Proc.new { |x| x + 2 }\n\n# Call the proc with an argument\nresult = add_two.call(5) # result will be 7\n\n# Also can use 'lambda' instead of 'Proc.new'\nmultiply_by_three = lambda { |y| y * 3 }\nresult = multiply_by_three.call(4) # result will be 12\n```\n\n### Lambdas\n\nLambdas are similar to procs, but there is one key difference: a proc will return from its enclosing method when it encounters the `return` keyword. A lambda, however, will always return from itself.\n\n```ruby\n# Define a method that uses a lambda within it\ndef using_lambda\n  my_lambda = lambda { return \"Lambda returned\" }\n  \n  # If we use 'call' on a proc instead of 'lambda', 'return' would exit the method\n  my_proc = Proc.new { return \"Proc returned\" }\n\n  puts \"Before calling lambda\"\n  result_lambda = my_lambda.call\n  puts \"After calling lambda\"\n\n  puts \"Before calling proc\"\n  result_proc = my_proc.call\n  puts \"After calling proc\"\n\n  [result_lambda, result_proc]\nend\n\n# Call the method and see the results\nresults = using_lambda\nputs results # Output: [\"Lambda returned\", \"Proc returned\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, you can see that when `my_lambda` is called, it returns from itself without exiting the `using_lambda` method. However, when `my_proc` is called, the `return` statement exits the `using_lambda` method entirely.\n\n### When to Use Which?\n\n- **Blocks**: Best used inline and are implicitly passed to methods that accept a block.\n- **Procs**: Ideal for more complex code or when you want to pass a bit of functionality around without using a method. They can be stored, passed, and returned.\n- **Lambdas**: Useful when you need the explicit control over `return` behavior. Lambdas behave like methods in terms of return.\n\nEach of these features adds flexibility to your Ruby code by allowing you to encapsulate and pass around functionality dynamically.",
