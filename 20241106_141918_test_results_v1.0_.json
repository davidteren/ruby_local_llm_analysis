      "response": "A Ruby module is a way to group together methods, constants, and other modules. It's similar to a class, but with some key differences.\n\nHere are the main features of a Ruby module:\n\n1. **Method definition**: Like classes, modules can contain methods defined with the `def` keyword.\n\n2. **Included**: Unlike classes, modules are included in other classes or modules using the `include` keyword. This makes their methods available to instances of the including class.\n\n3. **Mix-in**: Modules are often used as a way to add functionality (\"mix-ins\") to classes without having to inherit from them.\n\n4. **Constants**: Modules can also contain constants, defined with uppercase letters.\n\n5. **Single inheritance**: Unlike classes (which follow multiple inheritance), modules follow single inheritance. This means a module can only `include` one other module.\n\nHere's a simple example of a Ruby module:\n\n```ruby\nmodule Greetings\n  def hello(name)\n    \"Hello, #{name}!\"\n  end\n\n  GREETING = 'Hello'\nend\n```\n\nYou can include this module in a class like so:\n\n```ruby\nclass Person\n  include Greetings\n\n  def greeting(name)\n    GREETING + ', ' hello(name)\n  end\nend\n\nperson = Person.new\nputs person.greeting('Alice') # Output: Hello, Alice!\n```\n\nWhen to use a Ruby module:\n\n1. **Mix-in functionality**: If you want to add specific behavior to multiple classes without using inheritance, modules are a good choice.\n\n2. **Constant definition**: If you want to define constants that should be available throughout your application, defining them in a module can help keep your global namespace clean.\n\n3. **Mix-ins with constraints**: Since modules follow single inheritance, they can be useful when you want to add functionality but need to ensure that it doesn't conflict with other mix-ins (like when using the delegation pattern).\n\n4. **Organizing code**: Modules can help organize related methods and constants together, making your codebase easier to navigate.\n\nHere are a few examples of common Ruby modules:\n\n- `Comparable`: Provides a `<=>` operator for comparing instances.\n- `Enumerable`: Includes methods like `each`, `map`, and `select`.\n- `Singleton`: Allows creating singletons (objects with only one instance).\n- `Kernel`: Contains methods available in all objects (like `puts` and `nil?`).",

The `deposit` method adds the specified amount to the balance, while the `withdraw` method subtracts the specified amount if there are sufficient funds. Both methods raise an exception if the input amount is not positive.\n\nThe example usage at the end of the script demonstrates how to create a new `BankAccount` instance and use its deposit and withdrawal methods.",

      "test_name": "Error Handling",
      "prompt": "Show how to implement error handling in Ruby using begin/rescue blocks.",
      "response": "In Ruby, you can use the `begin`, `rescue` and `ensure` blocks for error handling. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```ruby\nbegin\n  # Code that might raise an exception\n  puts \"Hello\"\n  raise 'An error occurred'\nrescue => e\n  # Handle the exception (e)\n  puts \"Error: #{e.message}\"\nensure\n  # Code that will always execute\n  puts \"This block executes no matter what.\"\nend\n\nputs \"Program continues execution after the begin/rescue/ensure block.\"\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- The `begin` block contains code that might raise an exception (in this case, we're raising one intentionally).\n- The `rescue` block catches the exception and allows you to handle it. In this case, we're simply printing an error message.\n- The `ensure` block contains code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This is often used for cleanup operations.\n\nYou can also specify multiple exceptions to rescue:\n\n```ruby\nbegin\n  # Code that might raise an exception\n  puts \"Hello\"\n  raise 'An error occurred'\nrescue ZeroDivisionError => e\n  # Handle specific exception (e)\n  puts \"Divide by zero error: #{e.message}\"\nrescue => e\n  # Handle all other exceptions (e)\n  puts \"Unexpected error: #{e.message}\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, the `rescue` blocks are ordered from most specific to least specific. The first matching exception will be rescued, and the others will be ignored.\n\nAdditionally, you can re-raise the exception after handling it:\n\n```ruby\nbegin\n  # Code that might raise an exception\n  puts \"Hello\"\n  raise 'An error occurred'\nrescue => e\n  # Handle the exception (e)\n  puts \"Error: #{e.message}\"\n  raise       # Re-raise the exception\nend\n\n# This line will never be reached due to re-raising the exception\nputs \"Program continues execution after the begin/rescue/ensure block.\"\n```\n\nThis can be useful when you want to log or report an error but still want the original exception to propagate and halt execution.",

      "test_name": "Ruby Best Practices",
      "prompt": "Explain Ruby naming conventions and best practices for method and variable naming.",
      "response": "Ruby follows a set of conventions and best practices for naming methods, variables, classes, and modules. These conventions are designed to make your code more readable and maintainable. Here are the key Ruby naming conventions and best practices:\n\n1. **Variables:**\n   - Use `snake_case` for instance variables (`@var`) and global variables (`$VAR`). For example: `@user_count` or `$max_retries`.\n   - Use `snake_case` for local variables (`var`) and method parameters. For example: `user_count` or `max_retries`.\n   - Avoid using abbreviations unless they are widely understood (e.g., use `id` instead of `i_d`).\n\n2. **Methods:**\n   - Use `snake_case` for method names. For example: `get_user_by_id` or `calculate_total`.\n   - Prefix getter methods with `get_`, setter methods with `set_` or `=(...)` syntax, and reader/writer methods with `read_`, `write_`. For example: `get_user_by_id`, `user_id=`, or `read_user_count`, `write_user_count`.\n   - Use `camelCase` for accessor methods generated by Rails' scaffold generator.\n\n3. **Classes and Modules:**\n   - Use `CamelCase` for class names. For example: `User`, `OrderManager`.\n   - Use `ModuleName::` for nested modules. For example: `User::EmailValidator`.\n\n4. **Constants:**\n   - Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants. For example: `MAX_USERS`, `PI`.\n\n5. **Private and Protected Methods:**\n   - Prefix private methods with a single underscore. For example: `_calculate_tax`.\n   - Use `protected` for methods that should only be accessed within the same package or by subclasses.\n\n6. **Avoid:**\n   - Single-character variable names.\n   - Abbreviations that are not widely understood (e.g., avoid `i` instead of `index`).\n   - Hungarian notation (_prefixing variables with their type_).\n\nHere are some examples following Ruby naming conventions:\n\n```ruby\nclass UserManager\n  attr_accessor :user_id\n\n  def initialize(user_id)\n    @user_id = user_id\n  end\n\n  def get_user_by_id\n    #...\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def _calculate_tax(amount)\n    #...\n  end\nend\n\nclass User::EmailValidator\n  SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE_CONSTANTS = {\n    invalid_chars: /[^a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]/\n  }\n\n  def self.valid?(email)\n    #...\n  end\nend\n```\n\nBy following these naming conventions and best practices, your Ruby code will be more consistent, readable, and easier to maintain.",

      "response": "Ruby blocks are sections of code that can be passed around like objects to perform actions on various inputs. They provide a way to customize the behavior of methods in a flexible and reusable way.\n\nBelow are examples demonstrating the use of Ruby blocks, procs, and lambdas.\n\n1. Ruby Blocks:\nA block in Ruby is defined with the help of a block delimiter `{}` or `do...end` and it's executed immediately when defined. Blocks can take arguments if desired.\n\n```ruby\n# Using block with {}\n1.upto(5) do |i|\n  puts i\nend\n\n# Using block with do...end\n1.upto(5) do |i|\n  puts i\nend\n\n# Block with arguments\n['a', 'b', 'c'].each do |char|\n  print char, \" \"\nend\n```\n\n2. Ruby Procs:\nProcs (short for procedures) are objects that wrap a block of code so it can be passed around and called like a method. They are defined using the `proc` keyword.\n\n```ruby\n# Defining proc and calling it\nsquare = proc { |n| n * n }\nputs square.call(5)  # Outputs: 25\n\n# Using proc with arguments\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\nsquared_numbers = numbers.map(&square)  # Outputs: [1, 4, 9]\n```\n\n3. Ruby Lambdas:\nLambdas are similar to procs but they have a different scope with respect to local variables and they enforce the number of arguments passed.\n\n```ruby\n# Defining lambda and calling it\nsquare = lambda { |n| n * n }\nputs square.call(5)  # Outputs: 25\n\n# Using lambda with arguments\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\nsquared_numbers = numbers.map(&square)  # Outputs: [1, 4, 9]\n```\n\n4. Difference between Proc and Lambda:\nProcs have a `call` method to execute the block of code, whereas lambdas have both `call` and `to_s` methods. Lambdas enforce the number of arguments passed while procs do not.\n\n```ruby\n# Proc doesn't enforce argument count\nproc = proc { |a, b| a + b }\nputs proc.call(1)  # Outputs: nil\n\n# Lambda enforces argument count\nlambda = lambda { |a, b| a + b }\nputs lambda.call(1)  # Outputs: ArgumentError\n```",
